For this image the neural networks have this information about the bird:
- x
- y
- vy
- dead or alive

This is normal that there is no improvement, because the birds have to go through the pipes, but the neural network has no information about where is the next pipe.
We can still notice that there is quite a learning: in the test, there is a certain distance before the first pipe. We see that at the beginning the birds die before event the first pipe.
They probably always flap and reach the ceiling or never flap and fall on the floor.
After the 5th generation, they seemed to have learned how to fly when there is no pipe.

We need now to improve the information accessible to the neural network piloting each bird:
- the x is useless
- we need to keep the y and vy and also the 'dead or alive' state
- we need to add the distance to the next pipe
- we need to add the height of the next pipe
